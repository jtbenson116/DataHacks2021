# DataHacks2021: Bitcoin Ransomware Analysis

Given a dataset of Bitcoin transactions, we have created a model to classify transactions into illicit (ransomware) or non-illict (white) categories. Furthermore, upon identifying a ransomware transaction we were able to classify the transactions into the family it most likely originated from.
